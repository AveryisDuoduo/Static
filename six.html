      <h4>Fixed Wireless vs Fiber: Exploring the Future of ISP (Internet Service 
        Providers) Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>For years, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have witnessed a battle of
         technologies: Fixed Wireless versus Fiber. While many favor fiber due to 
         its reliability and multi-gigabit throughput, the rapid evolution of 
         wireless technology makes it a compelling alternative worth discussing. 
         In this article, we will explore the unique advantages and challenges of 
         wireless technology and make a case for its inclusion in the strategic 
         planning of ISP infrastructure.
