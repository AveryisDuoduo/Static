  <h1>How ISP works during rush hours?</h1>
  <p>Internet peak hours refer to the times when most users 
    are online at the same time. In the UK, this period 
    usually occurs between 7 pm and 11 pm. Users usually
     experience slowdowns when browsing or downloading 
     content at this time. This type of peak network 
     congestion is similar to traffic rush hour, where 
     resource demands exceed the network's carrying 
     capacity.<br>
     Compared with 2011 data, Google's 2017 analysis report 
     showed that daily network usage peaked from 9 a.m.
      to noon, then gradually decreased until a slight 
      recovery from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. And it drops to its 
      lowest at 4am.</p>
